    Welcome to the Shamestone! This is a place to share and release your shame, and to shed the burden of secrets and shame. By speaking your truth and letting go of the weight of shame, you can begin to start anew and take control of your life. No more secrets, no more shame. Join us on this journey of healing and empowerment. Together, we can create a supportive community where everyone's voice is heard and respected.</p>
  

  <h2 class="text-center">Share Your Shame</h2>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">If you find this stone, we invite you to take this stone with you and use it as a way to release your shame and negativity. You could keep it with you as a reminder to let go of these harmful emotions, or even use it as a talisman to protect you from negative energy. We also encourage you to leave the stone in a public place for others to find and use in the same way. You could leave it on a park bench, on a hiking trail, or even in a bookstore. Wherever you decide to leave it, just remember to be respectful and considerate of others. The stone is geotagged, so it can be located by others if they are looking for it. We hope you find comfort and peace through this stone, and that it brings you and others healing and joy.</p>
